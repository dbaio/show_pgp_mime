# A Roundcube-plugin to force-display pgp/mime ciphertext

This Roundcube-plugin forces Roundcube to display the encrypted part of
pgp/mime-formatted messages as text/plain.

Tools like Mailvelope <https://www.mailvelope.com/> can handle multiparted
messages fine, but only if they can get their hands on it.

To customize the text that prefixes the displayed message-part see localization/
